# ADUSA Procurement

• Spearheaded forecasting initiatives in a retail supply chain company, analyzing data trends and patterns to accurately predict inbound quantity for the upcoming 6 months improving efficiency.

• Built pipelines to reduce MAPE by 30% leveraging Prophet forecasting model on Databricks in Pyspark, aiming for PowerBI integration for real-time forecasting and weekly data refresh.

• Decreased processing time by 90% using HyperOpt - an optimization library, to fine-tune the Prophet model's hyperparameters automatically. Conducted a systematic search to identify the optimal combination of hyperparameters for improved forecasting accuracy.

• Configured the model's parameters to attain correlation of 93% removing anomalies, incorporating trend, seasonality, holiday effects and model changepoints that consider long-term trends and short-term fluctuation for accurate forecasts.

• Leveraged a range of visualization techniques, including line plots, histograms, and seasonal decomposition, to visualize and understand the underlying patterns, seasonality, and anomalies present in the data. By visualizing the data in different ways, we were able to uncover hidden patterns and identify potential factors influencing the target variable.
